[h1][b]Auto-auto-explore gives all empires the "Automated Exploration Protocols" tech at game start[/b][/h1]

I thought it was sooo silly that I had to wait until late game just to essentially offload and ignore one of the most monotonous aspects of Stellaris gameplay, so I made this mod.

If the game or some other addon suddenly creates a new empire and puts it in your galaxy, this addon will give them the auto-explore technology immediately when they research anything else. The first thing they research will also give them "Automated Exploration Protocols". Empires that are present at the start of the game get it immediately.

And so you don't forget that you have it, I did not hide the "research complete" popup.
